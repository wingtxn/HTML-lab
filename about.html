            <p><em>Hello! I'm Wing Tan—an ambitious 22-year-old UX designer who's passionate about creating intuitive, user-centered experiences.</em></p>
            <p>I feel very grateful to have been brought up in a household where it was encouraged to be artistic, whether it was through music, crafts, or drawing. I was always surrounded by creativity, even if it didn't feel like it at the time.</p> 
            <p>I'm the middle child in a family of three, with an older brother who was always coming home with his latest art projects, and a younger sister who, despite our age gap, has become one of my closest connections as we've gotten older. It was my brother's projects that inspired me the most to create my own artworks. I started to see the power of creating, of actualizing my visions and making something out of nothing.</p>

            <p>Being in the middle of the family meant that I spent a lot of time figuring things out on my own. I wasn't the oldest with expectations, nor the youngest with extra attention. That kind of “in between” position left me a lot of space to explore and experiment. It's where I found the freedom to start creating youtube videos, drawing, and later, designing. I wasn't always the loudest voice, but I found that creating was an avenue I had control over, where I could express myself and my ideas fully.</p>
            <p>It wasn't always easy, and sometimes I felt like I had to push harder to be seen or heard, but it was in those quiet moments that I began to shape the creative skills that drive me today. Design became the outlet where I could merge my love for creativity with my drive for independence. The more I experimented with visual ideas, the more I realized that design was my way of solving problems and communicating ideas in a way that felt uniquely mine.</p>

            </header>
            <p>As I continue to grow as a designer, I'm constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities. In the near future, I'm looking to dive deeper into user research and interface design, with a mix of projects. I want to create products that everyone, no matter their ability, can enjoy and use with ease.</p>
