                <h2><em>My Résumé</em></h2>
            </header>

            <p>I'm currently open to various opportunities with any relation to front-end sales, social media marketing, graphic design, and UX/UI design. With a strong foundation in both the creative and technical aspects of design, I am eager to apply my skills to projects that challenge me and push the boundaries of <b>what's possible</b>.</p>
            <p><em>In hopes of growing my skillsets,</em> I plan to expand my portfolio with both corporate and personal projects. Whether working on a team or independently, I thrive most in environments where I can learn from others while also applying my current skills and expertise. </p>
            <p>Feel free to take a look at my full résumé below. It includes a more detailed overview of my experience.</p>
